# Socket-Programing-using-python
A simple Programing simulating Emergency services Complaint Registration using TCP sockets.
A client contacts a server to get a service(police or medical)
and gets connected to the service server to register the complaint.
## What is this ?

  This python program utilzes AF_INET streaming sockets in other words,it sets up a TCP  IPv4 only connections
  so ensure that the client,server and the service_server processes are all connected within the same netwrok/router.

  Also,this code should be able to run in any OS/machine with a built-in python 3.x Interperter it should be noted that 
  it was tested extensively on a GNU/Linux machine having Python 3.8.10 interperter and a Windows 10 Machine.

## How does this work?

   1.The Client process Establishes a connection with the server processs requesting a paticular Emergency service ("police"/"medical")
   
   2.The server then responds with the I.P and port number which the client uses to contact the requested service
   
   3.The client then connects with  the service_server and fills up the data form which is registered as new file in the COMPLAINTS folder
   
   4.The service_server then sends an acknowledgement back to the client and  all connections are closed
   
## How to run  this?
  Please note that the unmodified source code can run only within the same machine
  but to run it across  two or three machines ensure that
  these programs run within the same netwrok/subnet 
  to do that type open terminal and type ifconfig (or ipconfig on windows command )
  and ensure that first 3 octets are same refer to the server.py source code comments and modify accodringly.

    
## How To Run This?
1)Download this repo as a zip&extract it  or git clone this repository
    
    git clone https://github.com/Fat-Krow/Socket-Programing-using-python.git

2)Create a sub directory/folder inside the downloaded repository called COMPLAINTS
    
    mkdir COMPLAINTS

3)Run the server
 
    python3 server.py
    
4)Run the Service server

    python3 service_server.py
    
5)Finally run  the client

    python3 client.py

  I did find  it very useful when I started out :)
